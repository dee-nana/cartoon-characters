        <p>"Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs" is a timeless fairy tale known worldwide. The narrative centers around Snow
          White, a kind-hearted princess whose beauty sparks jealousy in her stepmother, the wicked Queen. The Queen's
          obsession with her own beauty leads her to order Snow White's death when her magic mirror reveals Snow White's
          surpassing loveliness.</p>

        <p>However, the Huntsman assigned to the task cannot bring himself to harm Snow White, allowing her to escape
          into the forest. Lost and frightened, Snow White finds sanctuary in a small cottage inhabited by seven
          compassionate dwarfs: Doc, Grumpy, Happy, Sleepy, Bashful, Sneezy, and Dopey.</p>

        <p>The Queen discovers that Snow White is still alive and devises various plots to kill her, including the
          infamous poisoned apple. Disguised as an elderly woman, the Queen tricks Snow White into biting the poisoned
          apple, causing her to fall into an enchanted slumber that can only be broken by true love's kiss.</p>

        <p>A passing prince, enchanted by Snow White's beauty, arrives and awakens her with a kiss. Snow White and the
          prince fall deeply in love, and he whisks her away to his castle, leaving the wicked Queen defeated.</p>

        <p>The narrative delves into themes of envy, vanity, and the juxtaposition between good and evil. It underscores
          the potency of kindness, friendship, and the ultimate victory of love over malevolence. The seven dwarfs
          contribute humor and warmth to the story, providing a protective and nurturing haven for Snow White.</p>

        <p>Originally published by the Brothers Grimm in 1812, "Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs" has evolved into an
          enduring classic, inspiring myriad adaptations in literature, film, and other artistic forms. Disney's
          animated film adaptation, released in 1937, introduced the tale to a global audience and remains an iconic
          representation of this beloved fairy tale.</p>
